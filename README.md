👋 Hey there!  
This is **my first-ever GitHub repo** — a nostalgic collection of the basic HTML tags and concepts that I learned from none other than **Prashant Sir** during his web development course! 🧑‍🏫✨

## 🏗️ What's Inside?

1. 🔤 **All the HTML Basics** – From `<!DOCTYPE>` to `</html>`  
2. 🧱 **Semantic Elements** – Learn the difference between `<div>` and `<section>`  
3. 🎨 **Inline Styling** – Because CSS wasn't invited yet 😅  
4. 🔗 **Hyperlinks & Images** – Clickable magic and picture-perfect placements  
5. 🧪 **Practice Makes Perfect** – Simple demos to build rock-solid foundations

2. 🧠 It captures everything I learned, hands-on  
3. 💡 It’s simple, raw, and full of "Aha!" moments  
4. 📜 These are not just tags, they’re milestones
